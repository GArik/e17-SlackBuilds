# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

elementary: Elementary (EFL toolkit for small touchscreens)
elementary:
elementary: Elementary is a widget set. It is a new-style of widget set much more canvas
elementary: object based than anything else. Why not ETK? Why not EWL? Well they both
elementary: tend to veer away from the core of Evas, Ecore and Edje a lot to build their
elementary: own worlds. Also I wanted something focused on embedded devices -
elementary: specifically small touchscreens. Unlike GTK+ and Qt, 75% of the "widget set"
elementary: is already embodied in a common core - Ecore, Edje, Evas etc. So this
elementary: fine-grained library splitting means all of this is shared, just a new
elementary: widget "personality" is on top.
