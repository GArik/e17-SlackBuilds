This is a collection of SlackBuilds for building enlightenment [1] packages for
Slackware GNU/Linux [2].

You only need to run one single script 'build-git' to build all the packages.
Like this:

  # ./build-git

Script will build and then install every package. Packages will be available
in the +packages-git-$(date +%F)/ directory; themes will be available in the
+themes-git-$(date +%F)/ directory (you need to manualy install them).
It also computes pretty dependencies graph which you can view with dotty(1)
or kgraphviewer [3] (you will need requiredbuilder [4] and graphviz [5]).

There are also SlackBuilds for stable versions of the e19 packages and the
script called 'build-e19' that works in the same manner as 'build-git'.

Note that all SlackBuilds are completely independent from each other. So if
you want to update only one component, you can do it easily. Let's assume you
need fresh version of terminology application. You build the package like this:

  # cd terminology
  # ./terminology-git.SlackBuild

This will build the package for you. You can then upgrade/install it with

  # upgradepkg --install-new terminology-*.txz

By default all SlackBuilds run only one job to compile the source code. If you
want make to run several jobs simultaneously, set MAKEFLAGS to "-j[N]" where N
is a desired number of jobs. To get good CPU utilization run following:

  # MAKEFLAGS="-j$(( $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN) + 1 ))" \
    ./build-git
