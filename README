This is a collection of SlackBuilds for building e17 [1] packages for
Slackware GNU/Linux [2].

You only need to run one single script 'build-svn' to build all the packages.
Like this:

  # ./build-svn

Or if you have Slackware64, you should run it this way:

  # ARCH=x86_64 ./build-svn

Script will build and then install every package. Packages will be available
in the +packages-svn-$(date +%F)/ directory; themes will be available in the
themes/. It also computes pretty dependencies graph which you can view with
dotty(1) or kgraphviewer (you will need requiredbuilder [3] and graphviz [4]).

There are also SlackBuilds for stable versions of the e17 packages and the
script called 'build-stable' that works in the same manner as 'build-svn'.

Note that all SlackBuilds are completely independent from each other. So if
you want to update only one component, you can do it easily. Let's assume you
need fresh version of ephoto application. You build the package like this:

  # cd ephoto
  # ./ephoto-svn.SlackBuild

This will build the package for you. You can then upgrade/install it with

  # upgradepkg --install-new ephoto-*.txz
